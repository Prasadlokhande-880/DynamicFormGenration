# Dynamic Form Control Prototype

This project provides a dynamic form control generator prototype, which allows for the creation of customizable, validated forms based on provided configuration objects. The forms are created dynamically using Angular and can be easily integrated into various projects.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Generate forms based on provided configuration objects.
- **Custom Validators**: Implement both standard and custom validators for fields.
- **Flexible Input Types**: Supports various input types like text, number, date, select dropdowns, and checkboxes.
- **Built-in Validation**: Automatically validates fields based on predefined rules.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with custom form fields, validators, and components.

## Installation

To use this prototype in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-form-control.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dynamic-form-control
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Import the FormModule**: In your Angular project, import the `FormModule` from the prototype into your application module.

    ```typescript
    import { FormModule } from 'dynamic-form-control';
    ```

2. **Configure the Form**: Define the form configuration in your component as an array of form fields, each containing a field name, type, validation rules, and any other properties.

    ```typescript
    const formConfig = [
      {
        type: 'text',
        name: 'firstName',
        label: 'First Name',
        validation: [Validators.required]
      },
      {
        type: 'number',
        name: 'age',
        label: 'Age',
        validation: [Validators.required, Validators.min(18)]
      },
      {
        type: 'select',
        name: 'gender',
        label: 'Gender',
        options: ['Male', 'Female', 'Other'],
        validation: [Validators.required]
      }
    ];
    ```

3. **Bind the Form**: Use the form configuration in your template to dynamically render the form fields.

    ```html
    <app-dynamic-form [fields]="formConfig"></app-dynamic-form>
    ```

4. **Handle Form Submission**: The form can be submitted as usual, and the validation status will be managed automatically.

    ```typescript
    onSubmit(formValue) {
      if (this.form.valid) {
        console.log('Form submitted:', formValue);
      }
    }
    ```

## Custom Validators

You can easily add custom validators by creating a validator function that returns a `ValidationErrors` object. Here's an example of a custom email validator:

```typescript
import { AbstractControl, ValidationErrors, ValidatorFn } from '@angular/forms';

export function emailValidator(): ValidatorFn {
  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
    const email = control.value;
    const isValidEmail = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/.test(email);
    return isValidEmail ? null : { invalidEmail: true };
  };
}
```

## Development

To run the development environment locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (as mentioned above).
2. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.
